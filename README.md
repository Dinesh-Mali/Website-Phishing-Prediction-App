# Website-Phishing-Prediction-App
In this App, we are going to predict whether the given webpage is a phishing website or not with website details using ML.

# Introduction
We have a dataset that contains meta data of about 5000 legitimate and 5000 phishing sites. Phishing is a type of semantic attack, often used to steal
user sensitive information including login credentials and credit card numbers by misquerding as a trusted entity, enticing a vitim into clicking 
on a link or opening as attachment in an email or instant messages.

This is a large dataset with many data information, for which you might have to understand the meaning of the meta data before working on the dataset.

# Project Flow

1) Building a machine learning model to predict if a site is a phishing site ot not.

2) We build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.

3) We deploy the Django project on Heroku through github
